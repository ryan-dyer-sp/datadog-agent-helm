# Contributing

All contributions improving our Helm charts are welcome. If you'd like to contribute a bug fix or a feature, you can directly open a pull request with your changes.

We aim to follow high quality standards, thus your PR must follow some rules:
- Make sure any new parameter is documented
- Make sure any new feature is tested by modifying or adding a file in `ci/`
- Make sure your changes are compatible (or protected) with older Kubernetes version (CI will validate this down to 1.14)

Our team will then happily review and merge contributions!
